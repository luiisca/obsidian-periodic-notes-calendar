### Template Support

Templates use `{{}}` placeholders to dynamically insert dates and times. Each placeholder can include an identifier, optional adjustment, and optional format: `{{identifier[¬±adjustment][:format]}}`.

#### Core Placeholders

- `{{title}}` or `{{date}}`: Note's date
- `{{time}}`: Current time
- `{{currentdate}}`: Current date and time
- `{{monday}}` through `{{sunday}}`: Days of week

#### Natural Language Dates

Supports any date expression [Chrono](https://github.com/wanasit/chrono) can parse:

```
{{tomorrow}}
{{next friday}}
{{2 weeks from now}}
{{end of this month}}
{{5 days ago}}
{{last monday}}
etc
```

#### Date Adjustments

Add/subtract time using `¬±n[unit]`:

```
{{date+1d}}    // Add one day
{{monday-1w}}  // Subtract one week
```

Units: y(ears), Q(uarters), M(onths), w(eeks), W(eeks ISO), d(ays), h(ours), m(inutes), s(econds)

#### Custom Formatting

Add Moment.js format after colon:

```
{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}
{{time:HH:mm}}
{{next friday:dddd, MMMM Do}}
```

#### Example Template

```markdown
# {{title:dddd, MMMM Do YYYY}}

Created: {{currentdate:HH:mm}}
Week: {{date:w}}

## Planning

Previous: {{5 days ago}}
Next: {{in 2 weeks}}
```

Invalid placeholders remain unchanged for easy debugging. All date expressions respect your locale settings and default formats.

### Emoji Summaries

Emoji summaries allow you to add visual "stickers" to your notes on the
calendar, providing a quick overview of your entries. There are two ways to add
emoji summaries:

1. From the editor:

   - Type `#emoji-<your-emoji>` anywhere in your note (e.g., `#emoji-üéâ`)
   - The plugin will automatically extract the emoji and display it as a sticker
     on the corresponding date in the calendar view

![demo](path_to_calendar_ui.gif)

2. From the calendar:

   - Right-click on any date in the calendar view
   - Select "Add emoji"
   - Choose an emoji from the picker
   - The selected emoji will be added as a sticker for that date on the calendar

![demo](path_to_calendar_ui.gif)

These emoji stickers appear on top of the note icon in the calendar, allowing
you to quickly visualize the content or mood of your entries without opening
them.

### Customization

Override these CSS variables in your `obsidian.css` file for further
customization:

<!-- TODO: ensure they're still relevant -->

```css
body {
  --calendar-bg: var(--background-secondary);
  --calendar-border: var(--background-modifier-border);
  --calendar-color: var(--text-normal);
  --calendar-heading-color: var(--text-muted);
  --calendar-selected-bg: var(--interactive-accent);
  --calendar-selected-color: var(--text-on-accent);
  --calendar-today-bg: var(--interactive-accent-hover);
  --calendar-hover-bg: var(--background-modifier-hover);
}
```

### Bulk Management by Format

1. Go to Settings > Periodic Notes Calendar > Periods and add your desired formats to the list of recognized formats.
2. Bulk operations are immediately available for all formats in the list. Select a format to access its tools:
   - Left Button: Open a list of files using this format, where you can open, delete individually, or delete all files.
   - First Right Button: Rename files in other formats to this one.
   - Last Right Button: Remove this format from the list (existing files remain unchanged).

These features ensure effortless organization and allow you to experiment with new formats without losing control, making it simple to manage and update your periodic notes.

## Tips and Tricks

### Customizable Emoji Summaries

You can use emojis to provide a quick visual summary of your notes. The plugin
allows you to choose any emoji from the emoji picker dialog. Here are some
examples of how you might use them:

üòä : A positive day üìù : Significant writing done üèÜ : Achieved a goal üåü :
Important day üéâ : Celebration or special event

Feel free to create your own emoji system that works best for your needs!

### Natural Language Date Navigation

In addition to creating notes, you can also use natural language to navigate to
specific dates. Try commands like:

<!-- TODO: I dont remember if this command works in that way-->

- "Show me last Friday"
- "Jump to three weeks ago"
- "Open note for next month"

This feature makes it easy to quickly access notes without needing to know the
exact date.

### Rename All Periodic Notes in One Click

If your notes use different formats, like `YYYY-MM-DD` and `YYYY/MM/DD`, and you want to standardize them, follow these steps:

1. Open Settings > Periodic Notes Calendar > Periods.
2. Add all the formats you‚Äôve used to the list of recognized formats so the plugin can detect them.
3. Click the first button on the right under the format you want to use.

This process works for all periodicities, allowing you to quickly standardize your notes regardless of their original format.

### Open notes in a new pane

Ctrl/Cmd + Click on a date to open that note in a new pane.

### Reveal open note on calendar

<!-- TODO: not implemented yet-->

If you open a note from a different month, you might want to see it on the
calendar view. To do so, you can run the command
`Periodic Notes Calendar: Reveal open note on calendar` from the command palette.

### Pin commands

<!-- TODO: reword -->
For easy access to common commands you can pin them, just do ([docs](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)):
1. Open Settings.
2. In the sidebar, click Command palette under Plugin options.
3. Next to New pinned command, click Select a command.
4. Type `Periodic Notes Calendar` to see all available commands.
5. Select the command you want to pin from the list.

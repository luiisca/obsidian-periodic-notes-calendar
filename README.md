### Emoji Summaries

Emoji summaries allow you to add visual "stickers" to your notes on the calendar, providing a quick overview of your entries. There are two ways to add emoji summaries:

1. From the editor:

   - Type `#emoji-<your-emoji>` anywhere in your note (e.g., `#emoji-üéâ`)
   - The plugin will automatically extract the emoji and display it as a sticker on the corresponding date in the calendar view

2. From the calendar:

   - Right-click on any date in the calendar view
   - Select "Add emoji"
   - Choose an emoji from the picker
   - The selected emoji will be added as a sticker for that date on the calendar

These emoji stickers appear on top of the note icon in the calendar, allowing you to quickly visualize the content or mood of your entries without opening them.

## Tips and Tricks

### Customizable Emoji Summaries

You can use emojis to provide a quick visual summary of your notes. The plugin allows you to choose any emoji from the emoji picker dialog. Here are some examples of how you might use them:

üòä : A positive day
üìù : Significant writing done
üèÜ : Achieved a goal
üåü : Important day
üéâ : Celebration or special event

Feel free to create your own emoji system that works best for your needs!

### Natural Language Date Navigation

In addition to creating notes, you can also use natural language to navigate to specific dates. Try commands like:

<!-- TODO: I dont remember if this command works in that way-->

- "Show me last Friday"
- "Jump to three weeks ago"
- "Open note for next month"

This feature makes it easy to quickly access notes without needing to know the exact date.

### Open notes in a new pane

Ctrl/Cmd + Click on a date to open that note in a new pane.

### Reveal open note on calendar

If you open a note from a different month, you might want to see it on the calendar view. To do so, you can run the command `Periodic Notes Calendar: Reveal open note` from the command palette.

## FAQ

### How do I change the calendar start day?

You can set the start day of the week in the plugin settings.
